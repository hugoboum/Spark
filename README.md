# Spark Project (HUGO BREHIER) for MSSD ENSAI

A .pdf of the .ipynb script is available altough I recommend reading through the .ipynb .

Extract the files of prices (Prix2014.zip through Prix2017.zip) located in /github original/ to a  folder named /data/ to run the .ipynb .
They were too big to be uploaded uncompressed to github.
